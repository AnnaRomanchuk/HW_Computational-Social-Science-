Description
A small learning project for data processing in Python using Google Colab. It has two parts:
analysis of a batch of Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT results (batch.csv);
practice with functions plus parsing Wikipedia tables (the “2010 in film” page) and processing financial metrics (film gross revenue).
The project demonstrates work with pandas: reading CSV/HTML, cleaning columns, converting dates to timestamps, grouping, and computing “actual” work time by accounting for overlapping intervals.
